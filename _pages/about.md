Hello, nice to meet you online! My name is Jingyuan Li and I'll be very happy if you could call me William! It is my great pleasure to share my experience and idea online with you! Hope that we can be good friends no matter online or personally!

About My Education Background
------
I am currently an M.S. Student at University of California San Diego, majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and my current focus is Analog/Mixed-Signal integrated circuit design. Before I come to America, I was educated with a dual-degree undergraduate program hold by University of Electronic Sience and Technology of China (UESTC, Chinese Top 30) and University of Glasgow (UoG, QS 78) in the field of electronics and electrical engineering, where I received the Scholarship for Excellect Students for 3 times (once 10% level, twice 25% level), and was honored with First-Class.

About My Academic-Ralated Intrests & Skills
------
My current study focus is Analog/Mixed-Signal IC design. My study and research experience made me intrested in both analog and digital part of IC, where no matter the sophisticated physical characteristics of MOSFETs nor the diverse logic of circuits attracts me deeply. Till now, I am quite familiar with IC development tools like Verilog HDL, Altium Designer and Cadence Virtuoso, etc. In return, the immense interest generated from my study also inspires me to improve my skills in projects beyond curriculums, including RISC CPU design, Compute-In-Memory architecture design and circuits performance evaluation.

Apart from this, my diverse international summer/winter school experiences helped me expand my skill radar chart in other ECE-related fields like Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, where I mastered the utilization and synchronization of Python, MATLAB/Simulink, OriginLab and SolidWorks, etc.

Moreover, I am an excellent collaborator and goot at project organization, design thinking and problem solving, which always encourage me to undertake the leader's responsibility in teamwork and manage a team with the highest efficiency.

About My Life
------
I was born in Jiangyou, China, which is also the birth place of the most famous Chinses ancient poet, Li Bai, and that might cultivate my  great interest in reading poems, ancient articles and other kinds of literature. Presently, I am in America so I am trying to continune this hobby in Engilish in order to improve my English skills. I am an energetic person and love anything exciting, so I like watching football and car race, where Chelsea and Scrudia Ferrari are my favorite teams. However, I also enjoy peaceful life. It is always my dream to take my camera with me to travel around the world alone and record a lot of beautiful and unforgettable things.

About My Community Involvement
------
Apart from doing study well, community involvement is always the first things I consider. In the school, I tried to share my experience about study or student work with others. During my undergraduate study, I was willing to take the role of an advisor. I used to mentor a freshman class of 40 students from 2022, responsible for giving them academic and mental guidcance. To help my students well, I organized several workshops for them about university life navigation or specific topics like how to setup an embedded system. I like to help not only the people around me, but also people maybe I didn't know. In 2021, I served as a volunteer teacher in Tibet, teaching Tibetan students math, English and science, and I tried to continously helping the students there by using my scholarships I will always hold the belief that I should use the skills and techniques I have to help those people in need, and use this goal to constantly inspire me to do well in future.
