* Participated in a team of 10 students to construct a smart robot vehicle capable of performing 6 tasks, including line tracking and pattern recognition.
* Designed a set of inter-board communication method, helping to replace the function of a complex controlled unit with only a camera module.
* Constructed the carâ€™s distance measurement system using MbedOS and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors and developed an algorithm in Micro Python which could assign a flag for data ignorance to filter out the wrong data generated the distance sensors.
* Produced a pan-silt camera holder and tent-shaped mechanical arm gripper using SolidWorks modeling and 3D printing.
