* Designed a low power ECG amplifier with instrumentation amplifier (IA) structure, which consisted of a fully differential input buffer, a differential amplifier and a “drive-right-leg” common mode feedback amplifier with referenced input.
* Constructed a 2-stage amplifier with differential pair-common source structure, which achieves an intrinsic gain of 4000V/V.
* Adopted PMOS differential pair input and sized them to operate in sub-threshold region for noise reduction.
* Achieved a differential mode gain of 40dB, CMRR of 85dB in range of 1-250Hz, a total power consumption of 3.8 millionth watts and a total input-referred noise below 3 millionth Vin.
