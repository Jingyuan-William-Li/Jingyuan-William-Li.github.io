* Improved a 2-stage amplifier system consisting of 31 transistors, with folded cascode-common source structure and DC biasing circuits.
* Calculated the optimal expected gain, MOSFET overdrive voltage, sizes and power consumption based on the Gm/Id relation in PDK library.
* Designed the DC biasing circuits with a constant-gm reference and current mirror technology.
* Adopted RC compensation between 2 stages of amplifier for poles splitting, which increased the phase margin.
* Achieved a gain of 77 dB, unity gain bandwidth over 30 MHz, and phase margin over 67 degrees, and power consumption under 2.3 milliwatt.
