* Led a team of three to design a 2.4 GHz antenna suitable for Bluetooth application.
* Constructed the antenna by employing a half-wave printed dipole model and simulated the designâ€™s performance and efficiency using HFSS software.
* Utilized a 0.787 mm-thick PCB board made of Rogers 5880, determined the practical arm length to 54.25 mm using parameter sweeping, and verified its function by 3D gain plot and VSWR analysis.
* Completed the project successfully and ranked 3rd in the cohort of the EMFT course.
