* Developed an CNN model aimed at classifying pneumonia pathogens using patientsâ€™ chest CT images.
* Treated 18,000 chest CT scans from patients with COVID-19, SARS, and bacteria infected.
* Constructed a model of 3 convolutional layers and 3 max-pooling layers.
* Performed gradient comparison analysis to define the optimal parameter of each layer.
* Achieved a training accuracy of 97.9% and a testing accuracy of 91.8%.
* Scored 90 and was awarded "Distinction" in project evaluation (the highest level attainable).
