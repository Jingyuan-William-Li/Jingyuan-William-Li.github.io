* Measured a pulse response on a channel model and calculated the tap weights based on zero-forcing method in MATLAB.
* Designed a 5-bit voltage-mode transmitter driver with rigorous sizing for impedance matching under DC simulation.
* Adopted foot transistors and introduced enable signal to realize the function of tunable weights under different data rates.
* Conducted comparisons with current-mode driver and tested the tunability control using pass gate.
