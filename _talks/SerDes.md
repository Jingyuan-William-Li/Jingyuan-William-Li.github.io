* Conducted a pulse response test on a channel model, and calculated the integer tap weights based on zero-forcing method in MATLAB.
* Designed a 5-bit voltage-mode transmitter driver with rigorous sizing for impedance matching under DC simulation.
* Adopted foot transistors and introduced enable signal to realize the function of tunable weights under different data rates.
* Currently working on the eye-diagram analysis and circuits optimization for noise and jitter stability.
